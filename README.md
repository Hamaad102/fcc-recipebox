# fcc-recipebox

Link to view project: https://hamaad102.github.io/fcc-recipebox/

This is a project I completed from FreeCodeCamp (FCC). The challenge was to build a web app that stored simple recipes. The challenge was to allow the user to be able to store the name and ingredients of the recipe and make it so the information was saved even if they decided to refresh the page.

For this project I used the React library along with React-Bootstrap for styling and functionality.
